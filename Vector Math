Learning the Math Aspect in the Game Engines.  Notes is based on Freya Holmmer; they are designed Shader Forge in Unity.  The Video Title is Vectors & Dot Product - math for Game Devs 


// Part 1 //

/// 1-Dimensional ///

With a number line, we have numbeers (intergers) in one axis with positive and negative intergers.

In Game Dev, you want to think about the humbers as a representation,not just a number.  

Vectors are directions on the axis.  Question: what is the length of a vector.  You would reposnd, the length of a vector is #. 
	// Example //
		On the single axis, 0 to 3.  The length will be 3.  NOTEED: Length / Distance are positive number. 

The direction of the vectors?  On the axis, it can be either 1 or -1.  Sometimes that is called as a sign (x).  
	NOTED: if the sign = 0.  Depending on the implications,  it can be either return 1, 0, Error. Zero has no direction.  You usually multiply the direction  SOmetimes if the sign ended up a 0, you would perhpas return it to 1.
		pure mathmatically, 0 has no direction.  

// Function // 
	Sign X = direction 
					(either -1 or 1)
To get the Lenth of a value, you want to find the absolute value.  

	abs (x) = Length / Magitude  // Length are positive number. 

If you want to know length between two value.  Function:  distance(a,b) - abs (b-a)
	What does it mean to add something.  Adding is an offset. you are moving or increase.  
	Multiple is a scale.  
		Adding and multiply is a core thing to do because you could  convert from division and subtraction to addition or multiplication if you want to. 
		a + b 				a * b
		a - b = a = (-b)		a / b = a * (1/b)
